// You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files. 
// This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. 
// A partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something like _partial.scss. 
// The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file. 
// Sass partials are used with the @use rule.

// note - helper file to break up our css files for modularity & easier to maintain code
